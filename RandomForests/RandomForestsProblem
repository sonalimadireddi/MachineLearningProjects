Solving Random Forests Unsupervised Learning Algorithm Using R 
##########
PROBLEM STATEMENT: The input data consists of customers of a bank data. The problem is to build a model using random forests to predict whether the customers are likely to buy a loan product if a marketing campaign is launched and targeted towards customers who have loaned products from the bank in the past 

TECHNIQUES 
1) Random Forests 
2) Training and testsing 
3) Confusion matrix 
4) Indicator variables 
5) Binning 
6) Variable reduction 

DATA ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS 
-> Begin with setting the working directory and proceed with a visual pass of the data by observing the summary of the data
-> Since there are a large number of predictor variabls(16) as compared to the target variable(1) among all the vairables present(17) perform a correlation analysis to find out if any of the variables can be dropped.
->To perform correlation analysis and test whether the correlation co-efficients are above a certain given threshold use the library of "psych" and perform pairs.panels() function analysis 
->After performing the analysis of the data, create the new_data that contains information on the predictors that are of importance 

DATA TRANSFORMATION 
->Use the predictor of age to create bins of the data and use boxplots 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
->To create training and testing data 
->Using random forest function to create the model by using the training data
->Splitting the total data into training and testing data - the ration of 0.7 and 0.3 of 70% and 30%
->By using the importance of model as importance(model)

TESTING 
->Using the predicted data set 
->High error in inSample part (Yes vs No in the confution matrix) should be considered including the out of sample error rate
->importance(model) gives the value of the predictors, which illustrates the importance of the predictor
-> Within the confusion matrix, observe the diagonal of the matrix to discover the corrent number of yes's and no's
